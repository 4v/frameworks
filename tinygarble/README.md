TinyGarble is an implementation of Yao's garbled circuits, developed by
researchers at Rice University and TU Darmstadt.

TinyGarble extends Verilog, a hardware circuit description language, to generate
highly optimized circuits for use in Yao's garbled circuit protocol.
It requires the Synopsys Design Compiler, which is not open source. 

We were unable to produce any working examples. This Docker instance downloads and builds the TinyGarble source code. You can run computations on pre-compiled circuits following the [provided TinyGarble documentation](https://github.com/esonghori/TinyGarble#run-an-example).
