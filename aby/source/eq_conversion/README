Expected directory structure:

```
ABY
+--- abycore
+--- bin
+--- eq_conversion
|    \--- common
|    |    \--- eqtest.cpp
|    |    \--- eqtest.h
|    \--- eqtest_test.cpp 
|    \--- Makefile
|    \--- README
```


Requires a Linux distro and all the required packages for ABY. Once you have [ABY
running](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY), run

```
$ make
```

in the `eq_conversion` directory. Then, in two separate terminals, run

```
$ ./bin/eq_conversion.exe -r 0
```

```
$ ./bin/eq_conversion.exe -r 1
```


There are two circuits implemented here, 0/1 Test and Commutative Square Test.
You can only run one at a time. Uncomment lines 53-57 in `eqtest.cpp` to see
Commutative Square.
